Just a simple host for Unity to pull from for my vrchat map called Bvthroom.

Note to self and friends, image aspect ratio needs to be 3:4. Idealy something like 2700x3600.
Please rename the new file poster-01 before uploading, that way it just updates with the same link.
Currently the map is only using poster-01 but may use more in the future.
